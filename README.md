# Employee Retirement Analysis

## Overview

As some of our employees approach retirement age at Pewlett Hackard, HR decided to start planning for their upcoming employees leaving the company. This is a sample date of the people that will be leaving the company from all the business departments.

## Results

- Most of the employees in retirement age range are Senior Engineers. This could leave the company with a lack of knowledge when they all retire.

- The fact that only 2 managers are in the retiring range is good, as it means the company can keep going with the strong leadership that we have carried for a long time.

- At the same time, a little over 1,500 employees are elegible for mentorship from the retiring group. The initiative proposed from the sales and delevelopment departments could be appropiate to not let know-how leave the company's headquarters.

- The number of employees who can be mentored is not so large which means that, should the mentorship program starts, we would need to keep a small number of employees mid turns.

## Summary

In total, we will need to replace 72,458 positions in our offices worldwide. This will be a difficult task for the HR team that need to be considered soon.

If only the eligible to be montored are considered, we would need to keep 1,549 employees from the retirement pool half-time. Maybe a poll to know which of them want to retire now and which want to stay half-time is in order to determine how to proceed with that proposal.
